#MilBar - Enhanced Site Icon

## Description
__WIP: This plugin is under construction!__

A simple WordPress plugin to add Dark Site Icon (aka: favicon), and proper sizes support for your site.

The color of the favicon based on the `prefers-color-scheme` media query. Witch is [supported](https://caniuse.com/?search=prefers-color-scheme "Can I use") by the most modern browsers.


```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {}
@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {}
```
